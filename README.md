## How to talk to Computers 

**FPGA/ Aurdino Board** =>  An FPGA is an integrated circuit that can be programmed by the user after manufacturing to implement custom hardware functionality. It consists of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected through programmable interconnects, allowing users to create custom digital circuits. FPGAs are highly flexible and are used in a variety of applications such as telecommunications, automotive systems, and aerospace, where custom hardware is needed for high-speed data processing, parallel computing, and real-time systems.

The picture shown below is an aurdino board, the chip circled is the picture is chip that we will be learning about, this chip is a small component of the aurdino board, but it takes lots of intellegence to design it.
