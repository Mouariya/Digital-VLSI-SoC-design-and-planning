##  (a) How to talk to Computers 

**FPGA/ Aurdino Board** =>  An FPGA is an integrated circuit that can be programmed by the user after manufacturing to implement custom hardware functionality. It consists of an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected through programmable interconnects, allowing users to create custom digital circuits. FPGAs are highly flexible and are used in a variety of applications such as telecommunications, automotive systems, and aerospace, where custom hardware is needed for high-speed data processing, parallel computing, and real-time systems.

The picture shown below is an aurdino board, the chip circled is the picture is nothing, but the processor/SoC which is the heart of the this aurdino board, it has many pins coming outside to connect other peripharals devices with it or get signal in and out.

## Block Diagram of Above Aurdino Board

Here SDRAM is an external component that we have shown in the block diagram and remaining all blocks are from aurdino board and the rectangle block is nothing, but processor/SoC that has been circled in the actual aurdino board 

## This is how Processor/SoC looks like inside

This is called package, this is one of the package that we have in the market, there multiples pins available in the package that all are driven by the aurdino board

## This is how all pins are connected to the chip

These threads like wires are called wire bonds, these are used to connect the package to pins of the chip, and in this way we transfer the signals that are coming from the outer world to the proccessor 

## If we open the chip how it will look like ?

 **Let's See**

 Inside of the chip there are many components available, some important components are given below

 **PADS** :- PADS are somthing through which any signal comes inside the chip and vice-versa


 **DIE** :- Dies are the square/rectangular shape area that are manufactured on silicon wafer, and later on we implement the different logic blocks on these DIES
 

 **CORE** :- Core is the central area of the chip that are used to place the different logic blocks.

**Foundary IP's** :- Foundry IPs (Intellectual Properties) refer to pre-designed, verified, and reusable circuit blocks or modules provided by semiconductor foundries for use in integrated circuit (IC) design. These IPs are typically optimized for the specific manufacturing processes of the foundry, allowing IC designers to incorporate them into their designs without needing to develop certain functionalities from scratch.

**Macros** :- Macros are somthing which is a pure digital circuit logic blocks that are there inside the chip.


## Introduction to RISC-V:-    

This is nothing but the language of the computer, this is the way we are going to talk with the computer.

**Ex:-** If we want to run the C- program to specific hardware then there is certain flow through which it has to pass through as given below. That C-level program is first compile into assembly language program, which is nothing but the RISC-V assembly language program.

## From Software Applications to Hardware:-

![Screenshot 2024-12-15 131105](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10801c99-495b-4abd-ad6c-65d04f69b77c)

So here applications runs on the hardware of the our computer with the help of the intermediate stage "system software". So here application program enters into the system software and then system software interns converts the application program into binary language. 
The major components of system softwares are **Operating system (OS), Compiler, Assembler** 

**Operating System** :- It performs multiples job like, it handles input-output operations, it allocates memory , it manages low level memory functions. Other than this it converts the application program into assembly language program and then binary language program, so that it is to be understood by hardware.

**Compiler** :- Compiler converts the different types of programs written in different languages into the set of instructions, now these set of instructions are specific to the hardware that we are using, for example if given hardware belongs to ARM then set of instructions will be in ARM format.

**Assembler** :- Once complier is converted the different program into set of instructions then job of assembler is to convert these set of instructions into binary language or machine level language. Now these binary language is given to the hardware and it gives output as per its function and input.


##  (b) SoC Design and OpenLANE 

# Introduction to all open-source digital asic design

  For digital ASIC design we need **RTL IP's**, **EDA Tools**, **PDK DATA** all these things we need from the day one.

  **What is RTL IP's** :- RTL stands for "Register Transfer Level" At the RTL level, a circuit is modeled as a combination of registers (which store data) and combinational logic (which processes data). RTL is often used during the design and simulation of digital circuits before they are synthesized into a lower-level gate or transistor implementation.

  *Open Source for RTL IP's*: librecores.org, opencores.org, github.com etc

  **What is EDA Tools** :- EDA tools (Electronic Design Automation tools) refer to a set of software applications that are used to design, verify, and simulate electronic systems, including integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs). These tools help automate and optimize various stages of the electronics design process, from concept and architecture through to detailed design, verification, and final production.

  *Open Source for EDA Tools*:  Qflow, OpenROAD, OpenLANE etc.


**What is PDK Data** :- Collection of files used to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools used to design an IC 

*Process Design Rules*: DRC,LVS,PEX
*Device Models*
*Digital standard cell libraries*
*I/O Libraries*

*Open Source for PDK Data*:  github.com/google/skywater-pdk

## Simplified RTL2GDS Flow

**Synthesis** :- It is the process in which we converts the RTL to a circuits out of components from the "Standard cell library" (SCL), the resultant circuit is describe in HDL and usualy refered to the gate level netlist. the gate level netlist is functionaly equivelent to the RTL. "standard Cells" have regular layouts like Electrical. HDL,SPICE

**Floor/Power Planning** :- Floor planning depends on whether your implementing single components of the design or whole chip, the objective here is to plan the silicon area and creats robust power distribution network
